  "about1": "Long before we opened the doors, we started in our kitchen. We were aiming for nothing short of perfection.",
  "about2": "Today, every hand-pressed burger that leaves our kitchen is made from our unique blend of sirloin, round and prime Wagyu Beef. It’s authentic, free of preservatives and flame-grilled to juicy perfection.",
  "about3": "But we didn’t stop…",
  "about4": " How could we? Fries were about to be reimagined. Whether you order the fries, the potato slices or the potato wedges, they are all made from real Russet potatoes cut with the skin on. They’re washed in a cycle to remove the starch and cooked in vegetable oil for a crispy taste and golden exterior.",
  "about5": "All our products are served from the heart, and we look forward to serving you!",
